      <h1>Java Tutorial</h1>
      <p>
        Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is known for its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability, meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
      </p>
      <p>
        Java is widely used in web development, enterprise applications, mobile apps, and more. It is the core language for Android app development.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting Started with Java</h2>
      <p>
        To get started with Java programming, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK, an open-source alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have the JDK installed, you can use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code to write and run Java code.
      </p>
      <h2>Java Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Java has a syntax similar to other C-style programming languages. Here are some basic concepts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> Java supports various data types, such as int, float, double, boolean, char, etc., and allows you to declare variables to store different types of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditional Statements:</strong> Java provides if-else and switch statements to make decisions based on conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Loops:</strong> Java supports for, while, and do-while loops to repeat code execution based on specific conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Functions (Methods):</strong> In Java, you create methods to define the behavior of objects or perform specific tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Java is an object-oriented language, and OOP concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, play a vital role in Java programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> Java allows you to handle runtime errors gracefully using try-catch blocks.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Java Tutorial Example</h2>
      <pre>
<code>
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The above code is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Save the code in a file with the ".java" extension and compile it using the "javac" command. Then run it with the "java" command to see the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at some examples to better understand these concepts.
      </p>

      <h3>Example: Variables and Data Types</h3>
      <pre><code>
public class VariablesExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int age = 25;
  double salary = 50000.50;
  char gender = 'M';
  boolean isEmployed = true;
  String name = "John Doe";
  System.out.println("Name: " + name);
  System.out.println("Age: " + age);
  System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
  System.out.println("Gender: " + gender);
  System.out.println("Employed: " + isEmployed);
}
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        The above code declares variables of different data types and prints their values to the console.
